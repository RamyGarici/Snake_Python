🐍 Snake Game (Python)
A simple and classic Snake Game built using Python and the turtle graphics library. The goal is to control the snake, eat food to grow longer, and avoid colliding with the walls or yourself.


📦 Features
Classic Snake gameplay

Real-time movement with arrow keys

Score tracking

Game over detection

Clean and simple code (easy to modify or expand)

🚀 Getting Started
✅ Requirements
Python 3.x

turtle module (comes built-in with Python)

▶️ How to Run
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/RamyGarici/Snake_Python.git
cd Snake_Python
Run the game:

python main.py
Use the arrow keys to move the snake around.

🧠 How It Works
The game uses Python's turtle module to draw and animate the snake and food.

The snake grows each time it eats food.

If the snake hits the wall or its own tail, the game ends.

The score is displayed at the top of the screen.
